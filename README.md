# About me

I'm doing software development since mid 1980ies and also have long term experience in server and network administration. In my regular job I work as team lead.

My current topics:

- Codeberg und Forgejo
- Event sourcing and CQRS
- Nextcloud
- WordPress
- Android
- Electronis in general and microcontrollers (ATmega, ESP8266 etc.)

## Move to Codeberg

Due to the latest changes at GitHub in August 2025 I decided to move all my own repositories to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org).

If you want to (continue) to contribute, please see https://codeberg.org/askaaron.
